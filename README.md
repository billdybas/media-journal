# Media Journal

A record of interesting media (eg. blog posts, articles, conference talks) I've consumed.

---

I consume _a lot_ of media. Some may even call me an information junkie. This is my attempt at cataloging and categorizing media I've consumed which I've found to be influential, thought-provoking, useful advice, or just really good.

Hopefully this will also help me add some structure to my bookmarks - separating links I've saved which I liked from links I've saved to look at later (Much like [Daniel's Unread](https://twitter.com/danielsunread)), and get me to actively engage with the media I consume.

If you discover something new that you like, feel free to [spark up a conversation](https://twitter.com/billdybas) about it.
